	<h1>Hello!</h1>

	<div class="imageCollection">

	<h3>I'm Kenneth, a History and Computer Science double major at Yale University. I enjoy playing with code, writing, and making things (like my folding kayak)!</h3>

	<h3>My academic and professional interests are at the intersection of the humanities and technology. Some questions I think about are: How can we...</h3>
	<h3>...effectively communicate technology to various audiences?</h3>
	<h3>...better visualize and comprehend data?</h3>
	<h3>...improve humanities research using technology?</h3>

	<h2>MapSCAD</h2>

	</div>
	<p>MapSCAD is a personal project inspired by my love of 3D printing and my recent interest in data visualization. I created a Python module, jsonscad_builder.py, that provides an API for building 3D printable choropleth maps from GeoJSON data.</p>
	<p>See the project on <a href="https://github.com/ksunyan/mapSCAD">GitHub</a> and read the <a href="./projects/jsonscad_builder.html">documentation.</a></p>

	<h2>Data Visualizations</h2>

	<p>These are some of the visualizations I made for a data visualization course (Yale CPSC 446, Data and Information Visualization). I used the d3.js library to generate these images. Note: Since these are homework assignments; I am not permitted to make the source code public.</p>
	<h3>Mauna Loa Carbon Dioxide Levels 1958-2017</h3>

	<h3>Life Expectancy and Household Income by State</h3>
	<div class="imageCollection">
		<a href="https://ksunyan.github.io/images/states.jpg">
			<img src="./images/states.jpg">
		</a>
	</div>
	<p>Each state is colored by life expectancy at birth. Higher values are represented by darker shades of green.</p>
	<p>The radius of each state's centroid represents the median household income of that state. Higher values are represented by larger radii.</p>
	<p>Data are from the following sources:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/U-S-Life-Expectancy-at-Birth-by-State-and-Census-T/5h56-n989">CDC: U.S. Life Expectancy at Birth by State and Census Tract - 2010-2015</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/median-annual-income/">Kaiser Family Foundation: Median Annual Household Income</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>This Website!</h2>
	<p>I built this website using pure HTML and CSS. This project was an exercise in responsive web design and patience.</p>
